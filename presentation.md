####What's Going On?

####A webcamera working with a motion sensor in Studio-X demystifies the role of the space and its inhabitants by simply following movement within its view to be posted on the web.


###### The motion-tracking camera would necessarily adapt to broadcast different types of activity within Studio-X. During a lecture, it would remain trained on the speaker and audience, during an exhibition it might follow the paths of viewers, and on normal days it would give a sense of the workflow of the office.

###### Using Xbee tags, Studio-X could make specific installations, speakers, media, et cetera into clickable tags online in order to display more relevant information.

####"Web X...YZ"
We could play on the idea of projecting depth? Too cheesy?

####A website interface that allows an observer to interact with the observed. 

###### paragraph description

- This platform would initiate a conversation between digital and physical environment, combatting the potential flatness of the digital realm by providing a networking of communication 

- A website would begin as a live video feed of Studio X New York, where specific elements around the studio would be selectable, curated by those present at Studio X. A web observer would be prompted to explore this environment through a question prompt that would be projected physically onto a wall within the studio. Those present in studio would be encouraged to answer questions such as "what are you working on?" by physically drawing a response on a parallel wall. Thus invoking a conversation, a critique, a charrette or simply humoring a curiosity.

- When the studio is empty, the 'wall' would become a forum for critique and online interaction. While the physical space might be 'offline' users would populate the empty space with commentary and discussion among themselves.



one or more floor plans to show the key elements and how they interact

2 collages or renderings to illustrate key moments in the experience

diagram of how your objects will connect

images of each of the objects you will use showing how you plan to integrate the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, sensors, actuators, wiring and any other technical elements (can be custom drawings, collages with photos from the internet, or whatever best describes the object and how you will wire it up)

one or two images or videos from 2-3 reference 
projects that you are drawing inspiration from

inventory of parts (a simple list in text is fine)
