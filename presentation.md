##Xavatar

###Xavatar activates the standard "bio" webpage by linking tagged Studio-X residents to their online representation.

###Tagging Studio-X residents is the first step towards creating an experimental Studio-X scale "Internet of Things." Using an active RFID tracking system, people can be tracked real-time, allowing for their presence or absence and location on-site to be communicated directly to the web. Additionally,  tags are embedded with individual bios automatically updated with information on current projects. These tags are represented visually on the Studio-X website via real-time overhead plan view video feed: residents tracked on camera become "clickable" tags much like locations on Google Maps. A connected component might play on the standard bio page of static photos and blurbs with resident avatars appearing and disappearing and being updated on a real-time basis. Xavatar gives website users a direct and dynamic engagement with Studio-X residents, one which moves away from the flatness and artificiality of curated social media by making digital representation passively reflect the subtle fluctuations of daily use, the simultaneous boringness and unexpectedness of the everyday.

##"What's Going On?"

###A webcamera working with a motion sensor in Studio-X demystifies the role of the space and its inhabitants by simply following movement within its view to be posted on the web.


###### The motion-tracking camera would necessarily adapt to broadcast different types of activity within Studio-X. During a lecture, it would remain trained on the speaker and audience, during an exhibition it might follow the paths of viewers, and on normal days it would give a sense of the workflow of the office.

###### Using Xbee tags, Studio-X could make specific installations, speakers, media, et cetera into clickable tags online in order to display more relevant information.

####"Web X...YZ"
We could play on the idea of projecting depth? Too cheesy?

####A website interface that allows an observer to interact with the observed. 

###### paragraph description

- This platform would initiate a conversation between digital and physical environment, combatting the potential flatness of the digital realm by providing a networking of communication 

- A website would begin as a live video feed of Studio X New York, where specific elements around the studio would be selectable, curated by those present at Studio X. A web observer would be prompted to explore this environment through a question prompt that would be projected physically onto a wall within the studio. Those present in studio would be encouraged to answer questions such as "what are you working on?" by physically drawing a response on a parallel wall. Thus invoking a conversation, a critique, a charrette or simply humoring a curiosity.

- When the studio is empty, the 'wall' would become a forum for critique and online interaction. While the physical space might be 'offline' users would populate the empty space with commentary and discussion among themselves.
