Xavatar

Xavatar activates the standard "bio" webpage by linking tagged Studio-X residents to their online representation.

Tagging Studio-X residents is the first step towards creating an experimental Studio-X scale "Internet of Things." Using an active RFID tracking system, people can be tracked real-time, allowing for their presence or absence and location on-site to be communicated directly to the web. Additionally,  tags are embedded with individual bios automatically updated with information on current projects. These tags are represented visually on the Studio-X website via real-time overhead plan view video feed: residents tracked on camera become "clickable" tags much like locations on Google Maps. A connected component might play on the standard bio page of static photos and blurbs with resident avatars appearing and disappearing and being updated on a real-time basis. Xavatar gives website users a direct and dynamic engagement with Studio-X residents, one which moves away from the flatness and artificiality of curated social media by making digital representation passively reflect the subtle fluctuations of daily use, the simultaneous boringness and unexpectedness of the everyday.
